# Extended match

This library is meant to provide an ergonomic way to match,
compare and bind data in complex types such as maps and structs.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `exmatch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:exmatch, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]

```
